title:The Heart That Grew

Before you arrived,
we thought love had limits—
a cup to be emptied,
a flame that might fade.

Then you opened your eyes,
and suddenly the world shifted.
One tiny heartbeat
taught us what endless meant.

We love the way you stumble forward,
each step braver than the last,
the way your laughter fills the air
like music made of light.

We love the quiet moments too—
your hand resting in ours,
reminding us that no matter how far you go,
our hearts walk beside you, always.
